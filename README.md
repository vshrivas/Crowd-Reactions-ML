2) run.py: Creates an instance of Application, thus running the app
3) videoStream.py: Contains the VideoStream class, which handles streaming videos to the GUI from either the camera or a file.
4) crowdEmotion.py: Contains the CrowdEmotion class, which will be used to store near real time information on the crowd's emotional response.
